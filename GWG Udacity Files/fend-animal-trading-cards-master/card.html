			<p class="description">A lot of people like to get a dog or a cat for a pet. One can’t blame them because they do make great companions at home. They are affectionate, and some are even therapeutic. But if you’re not the conventional type, and you want something a little more unique, a pygmy goat is a very good option.</p>
